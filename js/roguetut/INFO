Updated with new code from ephemerant, click to move functions and sideways doors. (10/25/15)

Replaced old version with new phaser version
implimented working screens
Great tutorial on how:
http://tutorialzine.com/2015/06/making-your-first-html5-game-with-phaser/

! Also implemented fullscreen! Just mouse click screen when in game state
(fullscreen disabled since mouse click is now used to move, cannot work yet with fullscreen_key)

Note: menu and gameOver screens are buttons, activated on mouse click, not keyboard, just fyi.
      GameOver cannot be tested since game cannot be lost yet
      moveTowardsTile function does not work, breaking anything that uses it such as autopilot and click to move
      due to error in line 180 with call to movePlayer.
