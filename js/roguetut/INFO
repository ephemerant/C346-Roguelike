Replaced old version with new phaser version
implimented working screens
Great tutorial on how:
http://tutorialzine.com/2015/06/making-your-first-html5-game-with-phaser/
does not include all needed assets such as .mins and images already in the github

! Also implemented fullscreen! Just mouse click screen when in game state

Note: menu and gameOver screens are buttons, activated on mouse click, not keyboard, just fyi.
      GameOver cannot be tested since game cannot be lost yet
