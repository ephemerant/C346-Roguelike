main creates the states which will be the screens 
main starts first state, preload
prelaod loads all assets such as images and sounds for the game
preload is not necessary and can be done in each states preload, but I thought it would be nice to load everything at once here
Preload then startes menu state, Menu has a single button that when clicked starts the game state
Game state is the game, renders image and generates dungeon
on death (not implemented) start game_over state
game_over state has single button that starts game state again
