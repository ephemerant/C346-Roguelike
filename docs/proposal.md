We plan on creating a browser-based Roguelike game written in JavaScript. We will build the game on top of the [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) framework, although we will greatly expand upon its native capabilities. It is our goal to create a project that we can have fun creating, and that can also be enjoyed by the end user. We want to create a dynamic experience in terms of levels, enemies, and player.

Upon loading the game, a player will choose their name and place a few stats. They will then appear in a completely randomly generated dungeon filled with dangerous foes and glorious treasure. To progress to the next dungeon, the player must defeat the floor boss and enter the portal that opens. As they progress, difficulty will rise, and blood will be shed. Death is the only end.

### Features will include:

* Randomly generated levels
* Open-source graphics
* Camera/lighting
* Combat system
* Items that drop from monsters and also randomly spawn during level generation
* Stairs to progress to the next level
* Stat/leveling system
* Interactable menus
