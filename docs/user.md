# The Legend of Cheryl

## General Gameplay

* Any action (e.g. movement, combat, opening a door, etc) represents a turn
* For every turn you take, nearby monsters will also take one
* Find and enter the stairs to go to the next floor
* Every fifth floor has a boss monster guarding the stairs, so prepare wisely
* Shopkeepers and other helpful NPCs have a chance of appearing on each floor
* Monsters can drop both gold and items
* Boss monsters tend to drop more gold and better items
* Valuable chests are scattered throughout the dungeon
